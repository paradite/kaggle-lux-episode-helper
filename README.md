Open the competition [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2022-beta/leaderboard) or [submissions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2022-beta/submissions) page, the view episodes icon should turn green.

Click the icon to view the episodes and additional features (link to Lux Eye for now).

## Issues

It does not work if you navigate from another page to the [leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2022-beta/leaderboard) or [submissions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2022-beta/submissions) page.
